## Goal 
Welcome to **Blog App Application üé•** We‚Äôre here to help you exploring the world of bloging 
- Whether you want to watch and read or create your own with the ability to edit,save them and also delete all in one application


## Key Features 
I implemented a flutter application to represent the idea üì±by fully functional Blog App where users can log in, create, update, delete, and view blogs using GetIt for dependency injection and GetStorage for managing the login process.

1. **User Authentication**:
   - I implemented a login system using GetStorage and if the user is already logged in, a **Splach screen** will displayed and then will navigate to the home screen 
     otherwise, they should be prompted to log in and also can enter as guest 

2. **Blog Management**:
   only the loged in user can
   - **Add Blog** by filing the informations:
     - **Category**: The category of the blog post.
     - **Author Name**: The name of the author.
     - **Title**: The title of the blog post.
     - **Summary**: A brief summary of the blog.
     - **Content**: The full content of the blog.
     - **Date**: The date the blog was posted.
     - **Minutes to Read**: The estimated time required to read the blog.
     - **Post Image**: An image associated with the blog, selected via an image picker and if the user did not upload any a placeholder will be displayed

   - **Update/Delete Blog**: Allow users to update or delete their existing blog posts.

4. **Data Storage**: in the data storage i used GetStorage

6. **Saved Blogs**:
   - Also the loged in users can save their favorite blogs for easy access later.
